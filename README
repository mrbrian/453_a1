== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

Used composition of transformations to rotate/scale/translate the model instead of rotating the view.
Used separate timers for game and renderer to maintain a constant FPS.
Used QCursor::pos() to get mouse position, since mouseMoveEvent doesn't get called when the mouse is not moving.  (made it impossible to rotate the model and have it not spin afterwards)
Auto Increase speed 

Scoring system added, displayed via label at the bottom of the window.
The current game delay is also displayed at the bottom.
